# Milk_quality_prediction

The target variable is nothing but the Grade of the milk. It can be
### Target
### Low (Bad)
### Medium (Moderate)
### High (Good)
If Taste, Odor, Fat, and Turbidity are satisfied with optimal conditions then they will assign 1 otherwise 0.
Temperature and ph are given their actual values in the dataset.
We have to perform data preprocessing, and data augmentation techniques to build statistical and predictive models to predict the quality of the milk.
